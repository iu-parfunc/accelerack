0.  helpful walk-through of Racket macros very similar to what I was doing:
http://artyom.me/learning-racket-2


1.  Create SimpleAcc AST using data constructors found in 
accelerate-backend-kit/backend-kit/Data/Array/Accelerate/BackendKit/IRs/SimpleAcc.hs

This should be packaged into a Prog, which can be evaluated/run.
Intermediate data stored as ProgBind's.

2.  To run, so something like (simpleRunRaw BKEND dbgName p' Nothing), where p' = AST.

accelerate-backend-kit/icc-opencl/Data/Array/Accelerate/C.hs contains a function, runDetailed, which shows the breakdown of running an Accelerate program.  The phase 2 output is SimpleACC, but I'm not completely convinced.  Does evaluateSimpleAcc input or output SimpleAcc Prog?  Is p or p' the SimpleAcc Prog?
