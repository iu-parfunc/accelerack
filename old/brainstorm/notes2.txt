Try to keep things runnable on servers, tank at least, not just from within DrRacket.

Write a Racket program for dot-product, NBody, Mandelbrot

Math library unboxed arrays
 - conversion functions
 tuple of array, vs array of tuple
 
 Acc uses tuple of arrays, where our coding would often use arrays of tuples
 Having tuple-ref may de-complicate this issue (may eliminate need for lift/unlift)

 Make a deliberate choice of which ht implementation to use:
 Use a persistent data structure inside a mutable box 
 
 The AST gets built
 then compilation
  - type-check  ints --(assume all double, use 2.0,
  write down grammar of types (see Eric's PLT redex model)
  
  dot-product
  nbody
  
  rack vs acc
  
  ensure rack version is type safe
  
  rack generate acc version
  
  
  - normalize, after type check, flatten
