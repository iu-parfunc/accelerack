 ; - No, because the Acc AST presumably stores references.
 ; - But visibly, it should be.  It's all connected.
 ; - But, no, the constructors have been called in squence and have returned only pointers.
 ; - So, do we save the origination info?  Or do we not call out to the API until run?
 ; Should AccRack check for undefined variables?
 ; - Again, like redefinitions, DrRacket does a good job of identifying the error
 ; - Comment out the defns of y and see.

;; This could be more automated when this is packaged into one or more modules:
